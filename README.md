Repo consists of a python model built using SciKit-Learn in order to predict stolen base successes. 

main.ipynb consists of the code and model we built in order to predict stolen bases
stolen_base_features.csv is the final data gathered across multiple sources for analysis

Findings show we can predict a stolen base given the features used to 88% accuracy but more importantly, 97% precision

Precision was most important in this case as it suggests that 97% of the time we predict a stolen base, it will be correct.
